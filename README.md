2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </br>
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. </br>
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </br>
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. </br>
